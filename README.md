# Exploring Python Librairies one Visualization at a Time

This year, I decided to improve my visualization skills using python alone. I built a web app using strean to showcase and store my Python Visualizations.

Below is a demo of the web app

You can find the source code to every visualisation on the app or on this repo . You can also watch this space to get updated when the next visualisation drops
